#Page Oblect Model in python 


The Page Object Pattern (a.k.a the Page Object “Model”) is a design pattern that abstracts web page interactions for enhanced readability and reusability. Pages are represented as classes with locator attributes and interaction methods. Instead of making raw WebDriver calls, tests call page object methods instead. Page Object Pattern is arguably the most common pattern used for web UI test automation.
