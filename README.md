# Page Object Model in python 


The Page Object Pattern (a.k.a the Page Object “Model”) is a design pattern that abstracts web page interactions for enhanced readability and re-usability. Pages are represented as classes with locator attributes and interaction methods. Instead of making raw Web-driver calls, tests call page object methods instead. Page Object Pattern is arguably the most common pattern used for web UI test automation
